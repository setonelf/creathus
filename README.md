In order to create a automation to search a ZIP code I used Selenium on this project and the Page Object model
- The elements of the page was mapped and added on the pag_objects_pesq_cep.java
- The tests of search for a ZIP code valid and a ZIP code invalid it's on the cepAutomationTests.java file

Also in this project it was needed to create an API automation using rest assured
- The API tested could be checked on the https://restful-booker.herokuapp.com/apidoc/index.html
- All the features on API was tested and coded on ServerRestApiTests.java
